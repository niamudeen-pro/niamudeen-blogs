# Introduction

Handling unexpected errors in a React application is crucial for maintaining a smooth user experience. React's **Error Boundaries** provide a way to catch and handle errors in React components, preventing them from crashing the entire app. This guide will walk you through the implementation of an Error Boundary in React.

## What Are Error Boundaries?

Error Boundaries are React components that catch JavaScript errors in their child component tree, log those errors, and display a fallback UI instead of crashing the entire app.

> Note: Error Boundaries catch errors during rendering, lifecycle methods, and in constructors of the child components.

## When to Use Error Boundaries

Error Boundaries are commonly used in the following scenarios:

- **Wrapping critical parts of the app** (e.g., navigation, main content).
- **Third-party components** that might throw unexpected errors.
- **User interface components** like image galleries or forms.

## Creating an Error Boundary

To create an Error Boundary, define a class component that implements the `componentDidCatch` and `getDerivedStateFromError` lifecycle methods.

### Code Example:

```jsx
import React, { Component } from "react";

class ErrorBoundary extends Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = { hasError: false };
  }

  static getDerivedStateFromError(error) {
    // Update state to show fallback UI
    return { hasError: true };
  }

  componentDidCatch(error, info) {
    // Log the error to an error reporting service
    console.error("ErrorBoundary caught an error", error, info);
  }

  render() {
    if (this.state.hasError) {
      // Fallback UI when an error is caught
      return <h1>Something went wrong. Please try again later.</h1>;
    }

    return this.props.children;
  }
}

export default ErrorBoundary;
```
